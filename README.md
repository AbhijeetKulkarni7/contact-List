# 📞 Contact List using Singly Linked List

## 🎯 Objective

This project implements a **Contact Management System** using a **Singly Linked List** in Java. Each node represents a contact with a **name** and **phone number**, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, searching, and display operations.

## 🚀 Overview

A **Singly Linked List** is a dynamic data structure that allows memory-efficient storage and manipulation of elements. This project demonstrates how linked lists can be utilized to manage contacts effectively without relying on arrays or built-in Java collections.

## 🔹 Key Features

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation** – No fixed size constraints.
- **Add Contact** – Insert at the beginning or end of the list.
- **Search Contact** – Find a contact by name.
- **Remove Contact** – Delete a contact by name.
- **Display Contacts** – List all stored contacts.
- **Lightweight & Efficient** – Uses minimal resources and simple logic.

## ⚡ Operations Implemented

- `addContact(String name, String phone)` – Adds a contact.
- `removeContact(String name)` – Removes a contact by name.
- `searchContact(String name)` – Searches for a contact by name.
- `displayContacts()` – Displays all contacts in the list.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
